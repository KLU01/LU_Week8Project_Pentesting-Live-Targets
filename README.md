# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation Vulnerability


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration (Bold when username exists)
   - GIF Walkthrough: <img src='https://i.imgur.com/5dBpAis.gif' />

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XXS)


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work.
- Not much trouble other than it being tedious :'(
- For some reason... I was unable to implement the same exploits for some of sites a couple days after I had succeeded :/ So I don't have the gifs for those...
